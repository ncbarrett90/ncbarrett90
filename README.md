**Welder &#9193; Technology (Aspiring IT Professional, Welder, Contractor)**

I have spent the last five years in the [Welding](gsrphotos/gsrphotos.pdf) and [Construction](remodelphotos/remodel.pdf) industry, and I am now thrilled to transition into the rapidly growing field of technology. Currently, I am working towards my CompTIA A+ certification, which is providing me with a broad understanding of various technologies and the IT industry. I plan to use this page to document my learning journey and the projects I am working on.
